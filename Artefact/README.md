## Usage

Open index.html in a suitable web browser such as Chrome or Safari.

If you would like to use the control panel on my-account.html, then you will need to set up a local web server to comply with CORS policy. Feel free to do this accordingly.

Of course, features that are linked to the database, such as the mailing list, contact form, sign-in functionality, and control hub, will not work correctly without an internet connection.

If you would like to bypass the sign-in page and go straight to the control hub, change the URL slug from sign-in.html to my-account.html.

Note that the folder titled 'microbit' contains all the files related to the embedded system.
